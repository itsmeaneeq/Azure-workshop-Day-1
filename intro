Introduction to Cloud Computing
what is cloud computing ?
The On Demand Delivery of computing services like power databases, storage, applications and other IT resources using internet with pay as you go pricing 
IAAS :
Infrastructure As A Service 
offers Virtualized Machines and servers to host and wide range of applications 
Ex :Azure Virtual Machines
SAAS:
Software As A Service:
Delivers Software Applications over Internet, eliminating the local installations
Ex:Microsoft 365
PAAS:
Platform As A Service
Virtual platform to create a Custom Software where the users an focus on building deploying and testing upon underlying infrastructure
Ex: Azure App Service

Benefits of Cloud Computing
> Scalability
> Accessibility
> Improved performance
> Maintanence

Scalability:
Easily Scale Resources up or down based on demand ensuring optimal performance
Ex: Spotify

Accessibility:
Users can access cloud services and data anywhere with an internet connection

Improved Performance:
Azure provides high performance computing you can use CDN content delivery network to improve performance and also realtime tools
Ex:onedrive, gmail, google drive

Maintenance:
Azure handles all the infrastructure updates and maintanins it

Challenges in cloud adoption:

S-Strengths
W-Weaknesses
O-Oppurtunities
T-Threats

Strengths:
Scalability - cloud resources Easily Scale Resources up or down based on demand ensuring optimal performance
Cost Effectiveness - Reduces and maintains costs leads to sognificant savings

Weaknesses:
Dependence on Internet Connectivity - cloud services need reliable internet access and ditruptions can lead to down the service
Data Security and privacy concerns - storing sensitive data offsite raise caoncerns

Oppurtunities:
Growing Market Demand - increasing reliance on cloud computing by businesses 
Emergence of new tecnologies - innvation such as AI, ML, IOT can be integrated with cloud services

Threats:
Intense competetion - the cloud computing market is highly competetive
Regularity changes - changes in regulations regarding data protection and privacy can impact how cloud services work

On-premesis:
 something is located within a company's own facilities, rather than in a remote location such as a cloud or server farm
 it is also known as private cloud 
 it is a customer management where he manages all of requirements and no invlovement of cloud service provider
 
Data and  Access
Applications 
Runtime
Operating system
Virtual machine 
Compute
networking
storage

 The above requirements are all customer manages 

 Infrastructure As a Service :

  in this service,
  customer will manage 

 Data and  Access

 Platform As a Service :
  in this service, customer will manage
  
   Data and  Access
   Applications

   Cloud service provider will manage

   Runtime
   Operating system

   Software As a Service :

   in this service customer will manage

   Data and Access 

   Cloud Service provider will provide

   Physical Infrastructure:

   The physical Infrastructure of Microsoft Azure contains datacenters, servers, storage devices and networking equipment

   Datacenters : Azure has datacenters around the world, but they are not directly accesible

   Regions: Azure organizes datacenters into geographic regions
   factors to consider when selecting a region :
    Data privacy 
    Speed
    Service availabilty
    Ex: US cloud, china cloud have some restrictions

    Availability zones :

    Azure further subdivides regions into availability zones
    imagine as seperate datacenters within the same region, each with its own independent power source cooling system and dedicated network infrastructure

    . Core Architectural Components of Azure:

1. Azure Regions: Azure organizes datacenters into geographic regions
   Example:  US cloud, china cloud

2. Azure Sovereign Regions: They are not managed by Microsoft and may have restrictions to certain customers. These regions are isolated.
   Example: US, Germany and China.

3. Azure Resources: Each component in your Azure tenant
   Examples: Virtual Machines [VM]

4. Azure Data Centers: Azure has datacenters around the world, but they are not directly accesible
   Examples: North central [US], Japan west, etc.

5. Azure Suscription: We get access to deploy and consume the azure resources. It can be purchased and used for a period of time. Every Azure Account requires atleast one subscription
   Types: --> Free 
          --> Pay-as-you-go

6. Azure policies: It is applied at group level or sub level in order to restrict role based access control(RBAC).
